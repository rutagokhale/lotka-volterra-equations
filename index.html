                <p>Lotka initially started working on these equations in 1910. In 1920, he extended his model to ‘organic systems’, and in 1925 he utilized this model to analyze predator-prey interactions in his book on biomathematics. The same set of equations were published by Volterra in 1926. His work was inspired by his interactions with a marine biologist.</p>

Similarly, the population of Canadian lynx dropped when the population of snowshoe hair decreased. It clearly states that the population of the two species is inter-dependent on each other.</p>

                <p>This cycle of predator and prey lasts approximately 10 years, with the predator population lagging 1–2 years behind that of the prey population. As the population of prey grows, the predators can hunt more, hence the population of predators increases as well. When the population of predators reaches a threshold level, they kill a lot of prey, and thus the population of prey starts to decrease. This is followed by a decline in the predator population because of scarcity of food. When the predator population is low, the prey population starts to increase due, at least in part, to low predator pressure, starting the cycle anew.</p>
